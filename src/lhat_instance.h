// The engine reaches a scripted object through a table of function pointers
// rather than through a class, so this is not a godot-cpp class at all: it is
// a GDExtensionScriptInstanceInfo3 and the data it is handed back with.
//
// What sits behind it is one instance of the script's def^ (02 の 14.3) --
// the members shared with every other node running the same script, the
// self^ fields its own. That is why a node costs an instance and not a
// machine: 14.3 is what Godot's "one script, many nodes" already is.
